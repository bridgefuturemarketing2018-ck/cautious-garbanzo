# cautiouI can do it for you, but I can’t push to your GitHub without access. Pick one of these quick options and I’ll proceed:

A) I guide you step‑by‑step in real time (web UI). I’ll wait while you follow each step and confirm — easiest if you want me to watch and guide.  
B) I give exact git commands you can copy/paste (I’ll include any auth notes).  
C) I prepare the final README file here (so you can paste it once) and give short web UI steps — fastest if you just want the file.

Which do you want? Also confirm these two details so I do exactly what you expect:
- Do you already have a repository named exactly: bridgefuturemarketing2018-ck? (yes / no)
- If it exists, do you want to overwrite the current README (if any)? (yes / no)

Below is the final README.md ready to paste. Tell me which option (A, B, or C) and answer the two questions above and I’ll continue.
